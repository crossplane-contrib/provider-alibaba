# provider-alibaba

## Overview

`provider-alibaba` is the Crossplane infrastructure provider for [Alibaba
Cloud](https://alibabacloud.com). The provider that is built from the source
code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and
adds the following new functionality:

* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model Alibaba Cloud infrastructure and
  services
* Controllers to provision these resources in Alibaba Cloud based on the users
  desired state captured in CRDs they create
* Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource
  abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/concepts.html), enabling
  Alibaba Cloud resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services

## Getting Started

In the following, We will deploy flight tracker app using OAM and Alibaba RDS resource:

![alt text](./doc/img/flight-tracker.png)

Make sure you have installed:

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
- kubectl
- [helm](https://helm.sh/)

Then set up the environment on first trial:

```bash
helm repo add crossplane-master https://charts.crossplane.io/master/
git clone git@github.com:crossplane/addon-oam-kubernetes-local.git ../addon-oam-kubernetes-local
export ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id>
export ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=<your-access-key-secret>
```

Access key should be obtained via Alibaba clooud.

Then run command:
```bash
make demo
```
This will deploy the [Crossplane](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane), [addon-oam-kubernetes-local](https://github.com/crossplane/addon-oam-kubernetes-local), setting up cloud provider, and finally deploy an OAM app with a cloud RDS database.

Use the following script to wait until the database and the app has been deployed successfully and do port-forward:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

until kubectl port-forwrad deployment/web-ui 8080:8080; do
  sleep 5
done
```

The demo app could be access at http://localhost:8080 .
